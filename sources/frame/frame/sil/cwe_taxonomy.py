"""CWE hierarchy: relate a specific weakness to the broader classes it belongs to.

Frame reports the most specific CWE it can prove, for example CWE-89 for SQL
injection. Advisories, policies and compliance mappings routinely cite a broader
ancestor instead, for example CWE-74 (Injection). Without hierarchy awareness a
query for CWE-74 misses every SQL-injection finding Frame produced, which is a
correctness bug in advisory-driven triage, not a detection gap.

The edges below are `ChildOf` relations from MITRE's CWE-1000 Research view,
curated to cover the CWEs Frame emits plus their ancestors. This is deliberately
a *strict* encoding of the published hierarchy:

  * Only real CWE-1000 `ChildOf` edges are recorded. Weaknesses that merely feel
    related are not linked. In particular CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) is a
    SIBLING of the injection classes under CWE-707, not their parent, so a query
    for CWE-20 does NOT match a CWE-89 finding. Advisories often use CWE-20
    loosely; matching that looseness would manufacture agreement we cannot
    justify, so we do not.
  * A CWE with no recorded parent is treated as a root. Unknown CWEs never match
    anything but themselves, so an incomplete table can only lose matches, never
    invent them.
