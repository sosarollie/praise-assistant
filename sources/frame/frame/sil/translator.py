"""
SIL to Frame Formula Translator.

This module translates SIL programs to Frame separation logic formulas
for vulnerability verification.

The translation performs symbolic execution over the SIL CFG:
1. Track symbolic state (heap, taint, sanitization)
2. At each sink, generate a vulnerability check formula
3. Use Frame's incorrectness checker to verify if vulnerability is reachable

Key insight: We generate formulas only at security-relevant points (sinks),
not for every instruction. This keeps formulas small and verification fast.
