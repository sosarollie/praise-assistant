Cyclic proof-aware predicate unfolding

This module provides enhanced predicate unfolding that tracks proof states
to detect cycles and close branches inductively.

IMPROVEMENTS (2025-11):
- Added minimum depth threshold before cycle closure (prevents premature closing)
- Added predicate-specific cycle detection heuristics
- Added proof trace tracking with back-edges for true cyclic proofs
- Conservative cycle detection: only close when we're confident it's a real cycle
