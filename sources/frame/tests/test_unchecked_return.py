"""CWE-252: the result of a call that can only fail silently is discarded.

Unchecked-return checking has a bad reputation, and it is deserved. Most return
values in most programs are ignored perfectly correctly: nobody tests what
`printf` returned, `list.append` returns nothing worth having, and a failed
`close()` in a cleanup path is usually not actionable. A rule that fires on those
is not a detector, it is noise with a CWE number attached. So this one is narrow
along two independent axes, and both have to hold before anything is reported.

**Which functions.** Only APIs whose spec sets `return_must_be_checked`, and the
per-language spec tables set it only for the privilege-management family:
setuid, setgid and their relatives, plus chroot. These are the case where there
is no reading under which discarding the result is intended. If `setuid()` fails
and nothing notices, the process carries on holding the privileges it believes it
gave up, and every later access-control decision in that program is wrong. The
list stops there on purpose: `unlink`, `mkdir` and `close` fail routinely and are
ignored deliberately all the time.

**Which call sites.** Only calls with NO destination at all. `Call.ret` is None
exactly when the source wrote the call as a bare statement, so the value is
discarded before anything could have tested it. A call inside a branch condition
never becomes a Call instruction at all (it is inlined into the condition), and an
assigned result carries a destination, so neither is a candidate.

That second rule gives up a real bug: a result that is stored and then genuinely
never read. Frame will miss it. The alternative is to decide whether an assigned
value is "really" tested somewhere, and being wrong about that fires on correct
code. Missing a finding costs a finding. Guessing costs the detector its
credibility, which is worth more.

CWE-754 (Improper Check for Unusual Conditions) is deliberately not a detector of
its own. It is the MITRE parent of CWE-252, and `cwe_taxonomy.is_a` already makes
a CWE-252 finding answer a query for it, so emitting both would count one
weakness twice. This is the same argument that keeps CWE-400 from being its own
detector alongside CWE-770.

There used to be a SEPARATE, older CWE-252 reporter in
`analyzers/interprocedural_analyzer.py` that matched a regular expression against
each source line, over a much longer function list that included `unlink`,
`close`, `mkdir`, `read` and `malloc`. It reported discarded results from all of
them, which is exactly the false-positive behavior this detector is built to
avoid: an ignored `unlink()` in a cleanup path is correct code, not a weakness.
That regex reporter has been retired. CWE-252 is now emitted by the structural
rule alone, so `test_ordinary_posix_calls_are_no_longer_reported` and
`test_cleanup_unlink_is_not_reported` pin that the false positives are gone.
