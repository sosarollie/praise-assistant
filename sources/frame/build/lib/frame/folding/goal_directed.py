Goal-Directed Predicate Folding

This module implements goal-directed folding: synthesizing predicates from
concrete heap structures that help prove a specific entailment.

Unlike blind folding (fold_antecedent), this takes BOTH the antecedent and
consequent, allowing it to prioritize fold proposals that match the goal.

Algorithm:
1. Extract target predicates from consequent (what we're trying to prove)
2. Generate fold proposals from antecedent's concrete heap
3. PRIORITIZE proposals that match target predicates
4. BASE CHECKING: Verify concrete heap matches predicate's base (S2S approach)
5. Verify proposals for soundness
6. Return matching proposals

MULTI-STEP FOLDING:
7. Apply successful fold to antecedent
8. Repeat steps 2-7 until no more folds possible or goal reached

BASE CHECKING INTEGRATION (NEW):
Before expensive verification, check if the concrete heap structure matches
the predicate's spatial base (computed compositionally via S2S approach).
This provides early soundness filtering and improves performance.

This is much more efficient than trying all proposals blindly, and multi-step
folding enables long chains like x|->y * y|->z * z|->w to fold completely.
